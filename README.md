## The goal of the project was to build an interactive Rock-Paper-Scissors game playable in the browser. The player competes against the computer, with score tracking, a popup for results, and a reset feature after 5 rounds. The project also focuses on creating a clean and responsive user interface.

## Skills Demonstrated

- Writing clean HTML semantic Structure: Created a clear layout for game components, including score display, choice buttons,a popup modal, etc.
- CSS & Responsive Design: Applying styling, typography, and responsive media queries for mobile and tablet optimization.
- JavaScript (DOM Manipulation):
- Writing clean and readable game logic
- Adding  interactivity for player choices
- Implementing game logic to identify winners and update scores dynamically 
- Controlled popup visibility and game reset functionality
- Used event listeners to handle user actions
- Version Control (Git): Practiced branching, merging, and resolving merge conflicts

## Reflection 

In general, the project was very challenging but it allowed me to build basic JavaScript logic with DOM manipulation, turning a console-based game into an interactive web application. I learned the importance of structuring code for clarity, handling UI state changes and ensuring a smooth user experience across devices. Plus, I also gained practical experience with Git workflow and conflict resolution which will help me to manage future collaborative projects more efficiently.
